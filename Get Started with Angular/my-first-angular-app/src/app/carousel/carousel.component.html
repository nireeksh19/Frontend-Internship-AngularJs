<h2>Who is a Web Developer?</h2>
<p>In simple words, a web developer is responsible for the programming and coding of web-based services and websites that happens at the back end. It is often quite difficult to clearly differentiate between the roles and responsibilities in different web positions, such as web developers and designers.</p>


<p>However, we can safely say that web developers are more technically inclined than their web designing counterparts who are more focused on the look and feel of a website. The projects that web developers are involved in vary in complexity. They could be asked to work on simple web pages one time and multi-layered e-commerce web applications the other.</p>
<p>
  So if you are considering a career in web development, you need to be ready to work in a challenging environment where deadlines are a common phenomenon. </p>

<h2>What does a web developer do?</h2>
<p>The responsibilities of a web developer include talking to clients over the phone or meeting with them to understand their requirements. It is very important for web developers to get clear answers to questions like what a client wants their website to do for them.</p>

<h2>What features does a client want their website to have?</h2> <p>If you start working on the website before speaking to the client, the website won’t even be close to what the client expects you to deliver. You will be required to redo it. Waste of time, isn’t it? This is a lesson that every budding web developer needs to learn sooner rather than later to make successful strides ahead in their respective careers.</p>
<p>
  You may be asked as a web developer by your employer to work on both the front and end of websites. Or you may be asked to work on just one of the two aspects. Some developers use Adobe Photoshop to work on a website’s design while others are responsible for using programming languages like CSS and HTML to write the code.
</p>


<p>We are telling this to you to let you know that you need to be well-versed with all these aspects and that you should learn the skill that you don’t have. You are also required to have knowledge of web applications, software programs, and design principles. As a web developer, you can work a full-time employee with a company or a part-time consultant. You can even work as a freelancer. Here are some important responsibilities that a web developer fulfills:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Use PHP, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other such languages to design websites
    Build and test web applications</li>
    <li>Collaborate with web designers, graphic designers, and other professionals</li>
<li>Troubleshoot website problems</li>
<li>Track website traffic</li>
<li>Update and maintain websites</li>
</ol>
<p>Web developers also collaborate with project managers to ensure that the final product meets pre-defined designs, scope, and budget. You may even have to show your clients a prototype of the website to give them an idea of how the final product will look like. Let us now see what you can earn as a web developer in India</p>
